# OpenTelemetry in the Cloud

This repository contains all of the instructions and files needed to have a first introduction to instrumenting an applicaiton with OpenTelemetry. In this lab you will identify and resolve various bugs using New Relic as your observability platform.

## Requirements

* Laptop with Mac OS X. Windows is not supported for this workshop
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running
* A free account with [New Relic](https://newrelic.com)
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Minikube / Kubectl / Skaffold / Git: `brew install minikube kubectl skaffold git`

> If you prefer to download these requirements manually (instead of using homebrew) you may choose to do so using the following links: [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/)


## Getting Started

1. From a new terminal window, clone this repository to your local machine using Git `git clone https://github.com/Bijesse/otel-workshop.git`
2. Navigate into your new workspace using `cd otel-workshop`
3. Move onto part 1 of this workshop

* Part 1: [Setting up your environment](https://github.com/Bijesse/otel-workshop/blob/main/Part_1-Setting_up_environment.md)
* Part 2: [Debugging a slow trace](https://github.com/Bijesse/otel-workshop/blob/main/Part_2-Debugging-a-slow-trace.md)
* Part 3: [Building Spans](https://github.com/Bijesse/otel-workshop/blob/main/Part_3-Building-Spans.md)

-----
**!OLD STUFF Work in progress. don't look at me!!!!!!**



3. Run the following command to spin up your local environment 
```bash
minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 6
```  
Please note, this application is very resource heavy. You may need to adjust your [Docker Resource settings](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/)
4. Check that your cluster is up and running using the following command
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```




## Adding a delay

Your first mission is to add an artificial delay in one of the functions to see the full power of OpenTelemetry and distributed tracing. Letâ€™s say we want to know what exactly causes a delay in the frontend? Distributed tracing makes it easy for you to follow the journey of a request as it travels throughout your system.

<aside>
ðŸ“œ **In `main.go`, add a 0.1sec delay for the `createQuoteFromCount` and a 0.33 sec delay for `CreateQuoteFromFloat`functions.**

When you head into New Relic distributed tracing you should see something like this for your Distributed trace with your artificial delay clearly visible.

- **ðŸ™ˆÂ Solution**
    
    ```go
    func CreateQuoteFromCount(value float64) Quote {
    	...
    	time.Sleep(time.Second / 10)
    	...
    }
    ```
    
    ```go
    func CreateQuoteFromFloat(value float64) Quote {
    	...
    	time.Sleep(time.Second / 3)
    	...
    }
    ```

## **Building spans**

However, letâ€™s say we want to get one level deeper and want to see what caused the spike in the application. You are able to add custom spans to 

<aside>
ðŸ“œ **In the `GetQuote`function in `main.go`, build individual spans for the `createQuoteFromCount` and `CreateQuoteFromFloat`functions**

![Screen Shot 2022-05-15 at 5.44.23 PM.png](images/Screen_Shot_2022-05-15_at_5.44.23_PM.png)

- **ðŸ™ˆÂ Solution**
    
    ```go
    func CreateQuoteFromCount(value float64 , ctx context.Context) Quote {
    	ctx, childSpan := tracer.Start(ctx, "CreateQuoteFromCount")
    	defer childSpan.End()
    	...
    }
    ```
    
    ```go
    func CreateQuoteFromFloat(value float64 , ctx context.Context) Quote {
    	ctx, childSpan := tracer.Start(ctx, "CreateQuoteFromFloat")
    	defer childSpan.End()
    	...
    }
    ```
    
    ```go
    func (s *server) GetQuote(ctx context.Context, in *pb.GetQuoteRequest) (*pb.GetQuoteResponse, error) {
    		// 1. Generate a quote based on the total number of items to be shipped.
    	quote := CreateQuoteFromCount(0, ctx)
    }
    ```
    
</aside>

## Adding **span attributes**

Letâ€™s say that you wanted to add more context into the traces so you can get more business insights out of your data.

Attributes are keys and values that are applied as metadata to your spans and are useful for aggregating, filtering, and grouping traces. [Attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/go/manual/#span-attributes) can be added at span creation, or at any other time during the lifecycle of a span before it has completed. 

<aside>
ðŸ“œ **In the `ShipOrder`function in `main.go`, add code to attach the `state`, `zipcode` , and `city` attributes to each `shipOrder` span you created in the previous step!**

> When you are finished you should be able to see the attributes you added when you click on the shipOrder span â†’ attributes tab on the right panel.
>

> You should be able to run the `NRQL` query 
`SELECT count(*) FROM Span WHERE entity.name='shippingservice' FACET state`
to get the breakdown of all orders processed by state

- **ðŸ™ˆÂ Solution**
    ```go
    import (
        ...
        "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/attribute"
    }
    ```
    
    ```go
    func (s *server) ShipOrder(ctx context.Context, in *pb.ShipOrderRequest) (*pb.ShipOrderResponse, error) {
    ...
    	parentSpan.SetAttributes(
    		attribute.String("address", baseAddress), 
    		attribute.String("city", in.Address.City), 
    		attribute.String("state", in.Address.State))
    ****}
    ```
    
</aside>

## Adding Errors

Unlike system exceptions, application exceptions allow you to bubble up application-level activity that might cause errors, for example, invalid input argument values to a business method. 

<aside>
ðŸ“œ **In the `ShipOrder`function in `main.go`, add some logic to throw an error when a zip code is not a 5 digit number. It should show up like the screenshot below in NR1.**

![Screen Shot 2022-05-15 at 5.46.42 PM.png](images/Screen_Shot_2022-05-15_at_5.46.42_PM.png)

- **ðŸ™ˆÂ Solution**
    
    ```go
    func (s *server) ShipOrder(ctx context.Context, in *pb.ShipOrderRequest) (*pb.ShipOrderResponse, error) {
    ...
    **if(in.Address.ZipCode < 10000 || in.Address.ZipCode > 99999){
           parentSpan.SetStatus(1, "zipcode is invalid") 
       }**
    }
    ```
    
</aside>

### Setting the status for span

Following the [OTel specification for the Tracing API](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#statuscanonicalcode) , SetStatus sets the status of the Span in the form of a code and a description, overriding previous values set. 

The optionalÂ `Description`Â field provides a descriptive message of theÂ `Status`.Â 

`Description`Â MUST only be used with theÂ `Error`Â `StatusCode`Â value. An emptyÂ `Description`Â is equivalent with a not present one.

```glsl
SetStatus(code codes.Code, description string)
```

### What to set a status code

`**StatusCode`Â is one of the following values:**

`Unset` (code = 0 or unset) The default status.

`Ok` (code  = 2) The operation has been validated by an Application developer or Operator to have completed successfully.

`Error` (code = 1) The operation contains an error.
