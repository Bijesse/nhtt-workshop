# Lab 5: Passing the observability torch

After 6 years at Hipster Shop you have decided to move on. You have just put in your two-weeks notice as the lead platform engineer. You have accepted a new position at Gen-Z Fam Store that begins at the end of the month.

## Observability should not leave with you
When it comes to observability at Hipster Shop you have grown a reputation as the "New Relic guru" and you worry that other members of the team don't realize how invaluable the platform is to the company. You have been asked to spend your final two weeks setting up the team for success with New Relic after you leave. 

### Hipster Shop's current state 

At the moment, all of the custom dashboards, attributes, queries, alerts, synthetics, etc. within New Relic have been created and maintained by you. There are 8 other engineers who access New Relic about once a week. These people can make simple queries, and have helped you with specific tasks in the past but their understanding of the platform is limited.

### Your plan 
With your remaining two weeks dedicated to passing the proverbial observability torch you have decided you need to do the following:

1. Identify the resources provided by New Relic that others need to be aware of in order to be successful moving forward. *Things to consider: Relevant New Relic docs, New Relic staff responsibilities and roles, enablement courses provided by New Relic, automation to limit manual configuration, New Relic Partners, etc.* Be prepared to present on at least 3 New Relic resources. 
2. Create a presentation for a meeting that has been scheduled for you to lead on your final day at Hipster Shop. *In this meeting you will be presenting to executives and engineers. They are expecting to see a slideshow that includes everything they need to know moving forward as it relates how and why they should leverage New Relic after you leave.*

**One member of your group will create a Google Slidedeck that will be shared with other members so everyone can edit the same presentation. Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/144l0xoRWgLmFuQCgvv-CdURrDlO8-KsldJE_Rm2V98E/edit?usp=sharing) to get started.**
 
## Completing this workshop
After you have created your presentation, be sure to set the share settings to "Anyone from New Relic can view". You will be expected to share your plan of action with others later in this training.
